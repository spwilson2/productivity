TODO
====

* Add a way to track work on this stuff.
* Create a single file daily log.

* Add a wrapper around svn patch for a single file so I don't have to manually edit the patch files.
  i.e. This type of interface::

  svn patch patchfile --files <list of files to patch>

* Prototype git+svn workflow rather than using svn patches.

Complete
========

* Add blocking support into the python based editor script
