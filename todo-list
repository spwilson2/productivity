TODO
====
* Split up editor command functionality into different argument groups.
    * Send command to editor
    * Open editor/new tab in editor

* Modify the log command to use a python script to launch the log so it:
  * Insures there is an entry for the current day

* Add a wrapper around svn patch for a single file so I don't have to manually edit the patch files.
  i.e. This type of interface::

  svn patch patchfile --files <list of files to patch>

* Prototype git+svn workflow rather than using svn patches.

Complete
========

* Add blocking support into the python based editor script
* Create a single file daily log.
* Forward arguments from editor script to gvim.
